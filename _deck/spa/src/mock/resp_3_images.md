I can display and manage images with an interactive gallery. Here are examples of image rendering:

## Image Gallery

### Single Image
```image
https://picsum.photos/600/400?random=1
```

### Multiple Images Gallery
```image
https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=2
https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=3
https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=4
```

### Nature Collection
```image
https://picsum.photos/700/500?random=5
https://picsum.photos/700/500?random=6
```

The image renderer supports:
- Interactive zooming and panning with PhotoSwipe
- Gallery navigation with thumbnails
- Full-screen viewing
- Touch gestures for mobile devices
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)

Images can be provided as direct URLs or within image code blocks for organized display.
