## 🌍 The Challenge We Face

- **No clear product pipeline** in Business Model Canvas (BMC)
- Value propositions are reactive, not strategic
- Sales & Operations teams are **overloaded** with unclear demands
- BD teams spend time on strategy, but lack tools to **validate and execute**

> 🔴 Result: Misalignment, overcapacity, delayed launches

---

## 🎯 Our Goal

> **Enable Business Development to own the product pipeline**  
> using **AI + digital tools**, so that:
>
> - **Operations** can execute efficiently  
> - **Sales** can sell with clarity  
> - **Leadership** sees a clear roadmap

## 🔄 The Current Flow (Pain Points)

```mermaid

    A[BD Team] -->|Ideas only| B[No Feasibility]
    B --> C[Sales Gets Requests]
    C --> D[Ops Overloaded]
    D --> E[Delays / Errors / Burnout]
```

No validation. No data. No pipeline.

---

## 💡 The Vision: AI-Powered Product Pipeline

```mermaid

    A[BD Team] --> B[AI-Assisted Feasibility Study]
    B --> C[Validated Value Proposition]
    C --> D[Product Pipeline in BMC]
    D --> E[Clear Brief to Sales & Ops]
    E --> F[Smooth Execution]
```

BD becomes the **product engine**, not just idea generators.

## 🧠 What is Digital Literacy in Our Context?

It’s not about coding. It’s about:

- Using AI tools to **analyze markets, routes, pricing, risks**
- Turning ideas into **feasibility reports** in hours, not weeks
- Building **structured value propositions** with data
- Managing a **living product pipeline** in BMC

> 💬 “Digital literacy = using AI as your co-pilot for smarter decisions”
