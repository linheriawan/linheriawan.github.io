                        PnM is an escape of my daily activities as an employee, using this repos I will express and direct my interest which I divide into:
                        <ul class="list-disc pl-3 my-3">
                            <li>PnM Software: <p>First I'll create a framework then implement some concept of an Information System and its near surrounding.</p></li>
                            <li>PnM Appliance: <p>I too having amused with something innovative, so I prepare this section to begin making some IoT stuff here.</p></li>
                            <li>PnM Wierd: <p>and lastly for something wort mention but too far from other category. Here they will be..</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>"From a red chair as red as Pomegranate, and a glass of cold white Milk."<br/> I hope this repos can benefit others who seeks simple example, how to's, or even a starting point of their project.</p>

                        In the journey of my career as programmer, I found many companies run their business without an Information System, and survive or even growing. 
                        In contrary there is also company who want to pay lot of money to invest for an information system, which function and purpose is not fit for their business process. This decision leads to create over complicating and unnecesary process, thus wasting time and money.
                        <br/><br/>Many people tents to think, that every big IT Company with it's still surviving Software can solve their problems. It is correct, only if the solution is applicable to their business process.
                        But nowadays business expand, many business model and new activities created. 
                        <br/>The way of companies doing business, their culture, and innovation create more variated and unique process that become the identity of that company. 
                        Now begin the need of a software that can easily fit to company business process,  and hopefully PnM Software can fill the gap.
                        <br/><br/>Yes, custom application or framework is nothing new, you know it is just an opening words.. <br>And yes there is also reason not wanting to pay for a software, because they think it doesn't deserve payment. It is also why I create PnM, that will using BSD licence.
